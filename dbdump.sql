INSERT INTO `issues` VALUES (1,1,'The Legality and Morality of Abortion','Abortion is defined as the termination of pregnancy by the removal or expulsion from the uterus of a fetus or embryo prior to viability. An abortion can occur spontaneously, in which case it is usually called a miscarriage, or it can be purposely induced. The term abortion most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAbortion, when induced in the developed world in accordance with local law, is among the safest procedures in medicine. However, unsafe abortions (those performed by persons without proper training or outside of a medical environment) result in approximately 70 thousand maternal deaths and 5 million disabilities per year globally. An estimated 42 million abortions are performed globally each year, with 20 million of those performed unsafely. The incidence of abortion has declined worldwide as access to family planning education and contraceptive services has increased. Forty percent of the world\'s women have access to induced abortions (within gestational limits).\r\n\r\nThe abortion debate refers to discussion and controversy surrounding the moral and legal status of abortion. The two main groups involved in the abortion debate are the self-described \"pro-choice\" movement (emphasizing the right of women to choose whether or not they wish to bring a fetus to term) and the \"pro-life\" movement (emphasizing the right of the unborn child to live). Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position. Both of these are considered loaded terms in general media where terms such as \"abortion rights\" or \"anti abortion\" are preferred. In Canada, for example, abortion is available on demand, while in Ireland abortions are illegal. In some cases, the abortion debate has led to the use of violence.',1,'2013-02-09 06:21:52'),(2,1,'Wind Power','Wind power refers to the conversion of wind energy into electricity for use in the electric grid. The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources. At the end of 2010, worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generators was 197 gigawatts (GW). Wind power now has the capacity to generate 430 TWh annually, which is about 2.5% of worldwide electricity usage. Over the past five years the average annual growth in new installations has been 27.6 percent. Wind power market penetration is expected to reach 3.35 percent by 2013 and 8 percent by 2018. Several countries have already achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration, such as 21% of stationary electricity production in Denmark, 18% in Portugal, 16% in Spain, 14% in Ireland and 9% in Germany in 2010. As of 2011, 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis.\r\n\r\nA large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network. Offshore wind power can harness the better wind speeds that are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher. However, the cost of installing wind power offshore is higher than onshore. Although a variable source of power, the intermittency of wind seldom creates problems when using wind power to up to 20% of total electricity demand. As the percentage of wind power increases, so does the need to use other methods to mitigate the effects of its intermittency, such as energy storage.\r\n\r\nThe construction of wind farms is sometimes opposed because of visual impacts, concerns about noise and the health effects of visual flicker from the shadows cast by the rotating blades, local environmental impacts due to road construction, and concerns about habitat conservation.\r\n\r\nWind power is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and uses little land. In operation, the overall cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations. While fossil fuel-generated electricity is subject to the price volatility of the fuel source, the wind is virtually free.\r\n',1,'2013-02-09 06:21:52'),(9,1,'Global Warming','Global warming refers to the rising average temperature of Earth\'s atmosphere and oceans, which started to increase in the late 19th century and is projected to keep going up. Since the early 20th century, Earth\'s average surface temperature has increased by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F), with about two thirds of the increase occurring since 1980.

The oil sands are loose sand or partially consolidated sandstone containing naturally occurring mixtures of sand, clay, and water, saturated with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen (or colloquially tar due to its similar appearance, odour and colour). Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries, but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in Canada. Other large reserves are located in Kazakhstan and Russia. The estimated deposits in the United States could be as much as 2 trillion barrels. The estimates include deposits that have not yet been discovered; proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels. Total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at 249.67 billion barrels (39.694×109 m3) globally, of which 176.8 billion barrels (28.11×109 m3), or 70.8%, are in Canada. Oil sands reserves have only recently been considered to be part of the world\'s oil reserves, as higher oil prices and new technology enable profitable extraction and processing. Oil produced from bitumen sands is often referred to as unconventional oil or crude bitumen, to distinguish it from liquid hydrocarbons produced from traditional oil wells.\r\n\r\nOil sands extraction can affect the land when the bitumen is initially mined: water by its requirement of large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions. Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process. The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, 350.org, MoveOn.org, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition.

The oil sands are loose sand or partially consolidated sandstone containing naturally occurring mixtures of sand, clay, and water, saturated with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen (or colloquially tar due to its similar appearance, odour and colour). Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries, but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in Canada. Other large reserves are located in Kazakhstan and Russia. The estimated deposits in the United States could be as much as 2 trillion barrels. The estimates include deposits that have not yet been discovered; proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels. Total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at 249.67 billion barrels (39.694×109 m3) globally, of which 176.8 billion barrels (28.11×109 m3), or 70.8%, are in Canada. Oil sands reserves have only recently been considered to be part of the world\'s oil reserves, as higher oil prices and new technology enable profitable extraction and processing. Oil produced from bitumen sands is often referred to as unconventional oil or crude bitumen, to distinguish it from liquid hydrocarbons produced from traditional oil wells.\r\n\r\nOil sands extraction can affect the land when the bitumen is initially mined: water by its requirement of large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions. Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process. The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, 350.org, MoveOn.org, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition. The European Union has indicated that it may vote to label oil sands oil as \"highly polluting\". Although oil sands exports to Europe are minimal, the issue has caused friction between the EU and Canada. According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta\'s oilsands. Also, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Russia do not provide data on how much natural gas is released via flaring or venting in the oil extraction process. As a result of these, Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU.',1,'2013-02-19 11:47:22'),(2,2,'Wind Power','Wind power refers to the conversion of wind energy into electricity for use in the electric grid. The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources. At the end of 2010, worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generators was 197 gigawatts (GW). Wind power now has the capacity to generate 430 TWh annually, which is about 2.5% of worldwide electricity usage. Over the past five years the average annual growth in new installations has been 27.6 percent. Wind power market penetration is expected to reach 3.35 percent by 2013 and 8 percent by 2018. Several countries have already achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration, such as 21% of stationary electricity production in Denmark, 18% in Portugal, 16% in Spain, 14% in Ireland and 9% in Germany in 2010. As of 2011, 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis.\r\n\r\nA large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network. Offshore wind power can harness the better wind speeds that are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power\'s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher. However, the cost of installing wind power offshore is higher than onshore. Although a variable source of power, the intermittency of wind seldom creates problems when using wind power to up to 20% of total electricity demand. As the percentage of wind power increases, so does the need to use other methods to mitigate the effects of its intermittency, such as energy storage.\r\n\r\nThe construction of wind farms is sometimes opposed because of visual impacts, concerns about noise and the health effects of visual flicker from the shadows cast by the rotating blades, local environmental impacts due to road construction, and concerns about habitat conservation.\r\n\r\nWind power is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and uses little land. In operation, the overall cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations. While fossil fuel-generated electricity is subject to the price volatility of the fuel source, the wind is virtually free.\r\n',1,'2013-02-25 11:06:12'),(9,16,'Global Warming','**Global warming** refers to the rising average temperature of Earth\'s atmosphere and oceans, which started to increase in the late 19th century and is projected to keep going up.

The oil sands are loose sand or partially consolidated sandstone containing naturally occurring mixtures of sand, clay, and water, saturated with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen (or colloquially tar due to its similar appearance, odour and colour). Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries, but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in Canada. Other large reserves are located in Kazakhstan and Russia. The estimated deposits in the United States could be as much as 2 trillion barrels. The estimates include deposits that have not yet been discovered; proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels. Total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at 249.67 billion barrels globally, of which 176.8 billion barrels, or 70.8%, are in Canada. Oil sands reserves have only recently been considered to be part of the world\'s oil reserves, as higher oil prices and new technology enable profitable extraction and processing. Oil produced from bitumen sands is often referred to as unconventional oil or crude bitumen, to distinguish it from liquid hydrocarbons produced from traditional oil wells.\r\n\r\nOil sands extraction can affect the land when the bitumen is initially mined: water by its requirement of large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions. Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process. The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, 350.org, MoveOn.org, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition. The European Union has indicated that it may vote to label oil sands oil as \"highly polluting\". Although oil sands exports to Europe are minimal, the issue has caused friction between the EU and Canada. According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta\'s oilsands. Also, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Russia do not provide data on how much natural gas is released via flaring or venting in the oil extraction process. As a result of these, Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU.',1,'2013-04-22 22:42:03'),(17,1,'Keystone XL Pipeline','The Keystone Pipeline System is a pipeline system to transport petroleum products from Canada and the northern United States \"primarily to refineries in the Gulf Coast\" of Texas.[notes 1](USSD SEIS March 1, 2013 p.ES-2)[2] The products to be shipped include synthetic crude oil (syncrude) and dilbit (diluted bitumen) from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) in Alberta, Canada, and Bakken synthetic crude oil and light crude oil produced from the Williston Basin (Bakken) region in Montana and North Dakota.[2] Two phases of the project are in operation, a third, from Oklahoma to the Texas Gulf coast, is under construction and the fourth is awaiting U.S. government approval as of mid-March 2013.
